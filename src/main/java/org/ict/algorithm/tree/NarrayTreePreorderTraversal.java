/**
 * Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.
 *
 * Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal.
 * Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)
 *
 * Constraints:
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 104
 * The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
 *
 *
 * Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
