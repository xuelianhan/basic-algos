/**
 * The {@code TrieST} class represents an symbol table of key-value 
 * pairs, with string keys and generic values.
 * It supports the usual <em>put</em>, <em>get</em>, <em>contains</em>,
 * <em>delete</em>, <em>size</em>, and <em>is-empty</em> methods.
 * It also provides character-based methods for finding the string
 * in the symbol table that is the <em>longest prefix</em> of a given
 * prefix, finding all strings in the symbol table that <em>start with</em>
 * a given prefix, and finding all strings in the symbol table that
 * <em>match</em> a given pattern.
 * A symbol table implements the <em>associative array</em> abstraction:
 * when associating a value with a key that is already in the symbol table,
 * the convention is to replace the old value with the new value.
 * Unlike {@link java.util.Map}, this class uses the convention that values
 * cannot be {@code null}---setting the value associated with a key to 
 * {@code null} is equivalent to deleting the key from the symbol table.
 * <p>
