/**
 * Given a balanced parentheses string s, return the score of the string.
 *
 * The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:
 *
 * "()" has score 1.
 * AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
 * (A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "()"
 * Output: 1
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "(())"
 * Output: 2
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "()()"
 * Output: 2
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 2 <= s.length <= 50
 * s consists of only '(' and ')'.
 * s is a balanced parentheses string.
