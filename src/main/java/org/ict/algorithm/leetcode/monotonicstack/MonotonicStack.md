A monotonic stack is a stack whose elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. 
It contains all qualities that a typical stack has and its elements are all monotonic decreasing or increasing.

Below are the features of a monotonic stack:

It is a range of queries in an array situation
The minima/maxima elements
When an element is popped from the monotonic stack, it will never be utilised again.
The monotonic stack problem is mainly the previous/next smaller/larger problem. 
It maintains monotonicity while popping elements when a new item is pushed into the stack.
