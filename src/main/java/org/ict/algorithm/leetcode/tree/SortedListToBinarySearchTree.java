/**
 * Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order,
 * convert it to a height balanced BST.
 *
 * For this problem,
 * a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which
 * the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
 *
 * Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
 * Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
 * Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
 *
 * Input: head = []
 * Output: []
 *
 * Input: head = [0]
 * Output: [0]
 *
 * Input: head = [1,3]
 * Output: [3,1]
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 10^4].
 * -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
