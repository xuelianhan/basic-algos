     * (Number of Left binary search sub-trees) *
     * (Number of Right binary search sub-trees)
     * Now, since there are "n" nodes in BST and let,
     * the number of BST be represented by C(n) for n elements.
     *
     * We can find the number of BSTs recursively as :
     *
     * choose 1 as root, no element on the left sub-tree. n-1 elements on the right sub-tree.
     * Choose 2 as root, 1 element on the left sub-tree. n-2 elements on the right sub-tree.
     * Choose 3 as root, 2 element on the left sub-tree. n-3 elements on the right sub-tree.
     *
     * Similarly, for i-th element as the root, i-1 elements on the left and n-i on the right.
     *
     * These sub-trees are also BSTs so we can write :
     *
     * C(n) = C(0)C(n-1) + C(1)C(n-2) + .....+ C(i-1)C(n-i)..... + C(n-1)C(0)
     *
     * C(0) = 1, as there is exactly 1 way to make a BST with 0 nodes.
     * C(1) = 1, as there is exactly 1 way to make a BST with 1 node.
     *
     * 𝐶(𝑛)=∑𝑖=1𝑛𝐶(𝑖−1)𝐶(𝑛−𝑖)
     *
     * The above summation dissolves into Catalan Number.
