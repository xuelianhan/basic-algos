/**
 * Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.
 *
 * According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last,
 * is completely filled in a complete binary tree,
 * and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
 * It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
 *
 * Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Output: 6
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: 0
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: root = [1]
 * Output: 1

     * A Full Binary Tree (FBT) is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
     *
     * The height of a tree can be found by just going left.
     * Let a single node tree have height 0. Find the height h of the whole tree.
     * If the whole tree is empty, i.e., has height -1, there are 0 nodes.
     *
     * Otherwise, check whether the height of the right subtree is just one less than that of the whole tree,
     * meaning left and right subtree have the same height.
     *
     * If yes, then the last node on the last tree row is in the right sub-tree, and the left subtree is a full tree of height h-1.
     * So we take the 2^h-1 nodes of the left subtree plus the 1 root node plus recursively the number of nodes in the right subtree.
     * If no, then the last node on the last tree row is in the left sub-tree, and the right subtree is a full tree of height h-2.
     * So we take the 2^(h-1)-1 nodes of the right subtree plus the 1 root node plus recursively the number of nodes in the left subtree.
     * Since I halve the tree in every recursive step, I have O(log(n)) steps. Finding a height costs O(log(n)).
     * So overall O(log(n)^2).
