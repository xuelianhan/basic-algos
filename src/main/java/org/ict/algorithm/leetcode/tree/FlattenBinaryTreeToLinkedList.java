/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
 *
 * The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to
 * the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
 * The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
 *
 * Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
 * Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
 *
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: []
 *
 * Input: root = [0]
 * Output: [0]
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
 * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 *
 * Follow up: Can you flatten the tree in-place (with O(1) extra space)?
