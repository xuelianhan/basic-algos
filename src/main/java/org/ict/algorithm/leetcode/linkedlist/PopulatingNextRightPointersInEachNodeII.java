/**
 * Given a binary tree(not guarantee perfect)
 *
 * struct Node {
 *   int val;
 *   Node *left;
 *   Node *right;
 *   Node *next;
 * }
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node.
 * If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 *
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
 * Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
 * Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A),
 * your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B.
 * The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: []
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 6000].
 * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 *
 *
 * Follow-up:
 *
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

    /**
     * BFS - Right to Left
     *
     * Solution explanation provided by Abhishek(archit91)
     * It's important to see that the given tree is a perfect binary tree.
     * Now, we need to populate next pointers of each node with nodes that occur to its immediate right on the same level.
     * This can easily be done with BFS.
     * Since for each node, we require the right node on the same level, we will perform a right-to-left BFS instead of the standard left-to-right BFS.
     *
     * Before starting the traversal of each level, we would initialize a rightNode variable set to NULL.
     * Then, since we are performing right-to-left BFS, we would be starting at rightmost node of each level.
     * We set the next node of cur as rightNode and update rightNode = cur. This would ensure that each node would be assigned its rightNode properly while traversing from right to left.
     * Also, if cur has a child, we would first push its right child and only then its left child (since we are doing right-to-left BFS).
     * Once BFS is completed (after queue becomes empty), all next node would be populated and we can finally return root.
     * This means that each node will always have both children and only the last level of nodes will have no children.
     *
     * Time Complexity : O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the given tree.
     *   We only traverse the tree once using BFS which requires O(N).
     * Space Complexity : O(W) = O(N), where W is the width of given tree.
     *   This is required to store the nodes in queue.
     * Since the given tree is a perfect binary tree, its width is given as W = (N+1)/2 â‰ˆ O(N)
