     * as we donâ€™t need to generate the invalid Parentheses in the first place.
     * We can use two counters to remember the number of opening and closed Parentheses respectively,
     * and only backtracking those valid branches.
     * The invalid branches are cut-off and abandoned.
     *
     * The total number of different Parentheses is the n-th Catalan number,
     * which is 1/(n+1)C(2n, n) and the complexity is bounded asymptotically to 4^n/(n*sqrt(n)).

     * A parenthesis balanced string (of size 2*N) must have N number of '(' and N number of ')'.
     * We go on adding '(' before ')' for every recursive state string until count of '(' becomes equal to N.
     * Then we start adding ')' only on a condition that count of ')' is less than count of '('.
     * These two conditions will always produce balanced string.
