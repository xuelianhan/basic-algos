/**
 * 
 * Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 * Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 * Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 * Example:
 * Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
 * Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
 * Note:
 * You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
