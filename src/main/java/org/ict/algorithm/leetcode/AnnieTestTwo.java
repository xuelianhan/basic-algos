     * A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.
     * Any integer k, such that 0<= k < N - 1, splits array A into two 
     * non-empty parts:A[0],...A[K], and A[K+1],...A[N-1]
     * The difference between the two parts is the value of 
     * abs(max{A[0],...A[K]} - max{A[K+1],...A[N-1]})
     * Given a non-empty zero-indexed array A contains N integers, 
     * return the maximum difference between the two parts into which
     * it can be split.
     * For example, given the following array A:
     * int[] A = {1, 3, -3} the function should return abs(3 - (-3)) = 6 
     * int[] A = {4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 1} the function should return abs(5 - 1) = 4 at K = 3
     * Assume that:
     * N is an integer within the range[2, 100,000]
     * each element of array A is an integer within the range[-1,000,000,000, 1,000,000,000]
     * 
     * Complexity:
     * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N).
     * expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond 
     * input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments)
     *
     * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
