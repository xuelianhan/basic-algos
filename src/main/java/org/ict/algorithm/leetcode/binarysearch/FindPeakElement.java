/**
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 *
 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
 * If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 *
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
 * In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
 * or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

    /**
     * Understanding the following solution.
     * Given an array, we need to find the peak element.
     * As, the sub-portions of the array are increasing/decreasing ( only then we would be able to find peak ),
     * there are sub-portions of array which are sorted, so we could use binary search to get this problem done.
     * But exactly how ?
     *
     * This is an interesting part.
     *
     * For a mid element, there could be three possible cases :
     * Case 1 : mid lies on the right of our result peak ( Observation : Our peak element search space is leftside )
     * Case 2 : mid is equal to the peak element ( Observation : mid element is greater than its neighbors )
     * Case 3 : mid lies on the left. ( Observation : Our peak element search space is rightside )
     *
     * Some base cases :
     *
     * The array could be strictly increasing or strictly decreasing and as we have to return any of the possible peaks,
     * so we could add a condition to check whether the 1st element/last element could be the peak.
     * This point is being also supported by the fact that,
     * we are looking for mid-1/ mid+1, and these indices compromised for 0th index / n-1 th index respectively.
