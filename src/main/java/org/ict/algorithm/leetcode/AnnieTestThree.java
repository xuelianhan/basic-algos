     * A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.
     * The array is sorted in ascending order and it does not contain
     * duplicate values. The array describes a number K as follows:
     *   K = power2(A[0]) + power2(A[1]) + ... + power2(A[N - 1])
     * write a function that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A
     * consisting of N non-negative integers, returns the number of bits
     * set to 1 in the binary representation of the number 3*K, where K 
     * is the number described by array A.
     * 
     * Assume that:
     *   N is an integer within the range[1, 10,000]
     *   each element of array A is an integer within the range
     *   [0,...1,000,000,000]
     *   array A is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     *   array A does not contain duplicates.
     *
     * Complexity:
     *   expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
     *   expected worst-case space complexity is O(1),beyond input storage
     *   (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
     *
     * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
