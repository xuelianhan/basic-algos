/**
 * Description
 * You are now given a two-dimensional tabular graph ,
 * in which each grid contains a integer num.
 *
 * If num is - 2, it means this grid is the starting grid.
 * If num is - 3, it means this grid is the ending grid.
 * If num is - 1, it means this grid has an obstacle on it, and you can't move to it.
 * If num is a positive number or 0ï¼Œyou can walk normally on it.
 *
 * In each move you can travel from one grid to another if and only if they're next to each other,
 * or they contain the same positive number num. The cost of each move is 1.
 *
 * Now you are asked to find the lowest cost of travelling from the starting grid to the ending grid.
 * If the ending grid could not be reached, print -1.
 * It is guaranteed that the maximum number of rows and columns is 400, and the number in each grid will not exceed 50.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:[[1,0,-1,1],
 *        [-2,0,1,-3],
 *        [2,2,0,0]]
 * Output:3
 * In this example,you can reach the ending grid through these moves:
 * First, move up from the starting grid to the grid that contains the number 1.
 * Second, move to the grid with the same number at the top right.
 * Finally, move down to the ending grid.
 * There are three moves in total, so the minimum cost will be 3.
