 * Implement a rate limiter,

 * timestamp: The current timestamp, which is an integer and in second unit.
 * event: The string to distinct different event. for example, "login" or "signup".
 * rate: The rate of the limit.
 * 1/s (1 time per second),
 * 2/m (2 times per minute),
 * 10/h (10 times per hour),
 * 100/d (100 times per day).
 * The format is [integer]/[s/m/h/d].
 * increment: Whether we should increase the counter.
 * (or take this call as a hit of the given event)„ÄÅ
 * The method should return true or false to indicate the event is limited or not.
 * Note: Login failure is not recorded in login times.
