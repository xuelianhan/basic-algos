/**
 * Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 10
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 0
 * Output: 0
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: 0
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 0 <= n <= 5 * 10^6

     * The following solution is easy understood and short enough for interview.
     *
     * Checking all the integers in the range [1, n - 1] is not efficient.
     * Think about a better approach.
     * Since most of the numbers are not primes, we need a fast approach to exclude the non-prime integers.
     * An efficient solution is to use Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes up to the given limit.
     * Then we compute a prefix array to store counts till every value before limit.
     * Once we have a prefix array,
     * we can answer queries in O(1) time.
     * We just need to return prefix[R] â€“ prefix[L-1].
