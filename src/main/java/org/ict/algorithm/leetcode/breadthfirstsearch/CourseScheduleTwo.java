/**
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take
 * course 1, which is expressed as a pair:[0, 1]
 *
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of
 * courses you should take to finish all courses.
 *
 * There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is 
 * impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array;
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: 2, [[1, 0]]
 * Output: [0, 1]
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you
 * should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is[0, 1].
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input 4, [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]]
 * Output: [0, 1, 2, 3] or [0, 2, 1, 3]
 *
 * Note:
 * 1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency
 * matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
 * 2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
