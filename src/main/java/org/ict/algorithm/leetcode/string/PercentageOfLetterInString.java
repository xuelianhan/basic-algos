/**
 * Given a string s and a character letter,
 * return the percentage of characters in s that equal letter rounded down to the nearest whole percent.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "foobar", letter = "o"
 * Output: 33
 * Explanation:
 * The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'o' is 2 / 6 * 100% = 33% when rounded down, so we return 33.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "jjjj", letter = "k"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * The percentage of characters in s that equal the letter 'k' is 0%, so we return 0.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 100
 * s consists of lowercase English letters.
 * letter is a lowercase English letter.

         * That avoids a cast.
         * But you'll find that the cast conversions are well-defined.
         * You don't have to guess, just check the JLS.
         * int to double is a widening conversion. From ยง5.1.2:
         *
         * Widening primitive conversions do not lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value.
         *
         * [...]
         *
         * Conversion of an int or a long value to float,
         * or of a long value to double, may result in loss of precision-that is,
         * the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value.
         * In this case, the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value,
         * using IEEE754 round-to-nearest mode (ยง4.2.4).
