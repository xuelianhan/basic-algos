/**
 * Implement a queue with two stacks,
 * using n elements to perform n insertions of integers at the end of the queue (push),
 * and n deletions of integers at the head of the queue (pop).
 * The elements of the queue are of type int.
 * The operation is guaranteed to be legal, i.e.,
 * the pop operation is guaranteed to have an element already in the queue.
 *
 * Data range: n â‰¤ 1000
 * Requirement:
 * The space complexity of storing n elements is O(n),
 * The time complexity of both insertion and deletion is O(1)
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: ["PSH1","PSH2","POP","POP"]
 * Expected: 1, 2
 * Description:
 * "PSH1":stands for inserting 1 to the end of the queue
 * "PSH2":represents the insertion of 2 at the end of the queue
 * "POP":represents the deletion of an element, first in first out => return 1
 * "POP":represents the deletion of an element, first in first out => return 2
 *
 * Example 2:
 * ["PSH2","POP","PSH1","POP"]
 * Expected: 2, 1
