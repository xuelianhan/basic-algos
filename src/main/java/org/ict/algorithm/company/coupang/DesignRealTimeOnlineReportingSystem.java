/**
 * Online structure drawing,Real-time online reporting system design based on upstream RDS data
 * The RDS database stores the raw data.
 * The Kafka cluster is used to ingest the data from the RDS database and make it available to the Spark cluster.
 * The Spark cluster is used to process the data and generate the reports.
 * The Elasticsearch cluster is used to store the reports and make them searchable.
 * The UI is used to visualize the reports.
 *
 * Here is a more detailed explanation of each component:
 *
 * RDS: The RDS database stores the raw data. The data can be structured or unstructured.
 * Kafka: The Kafka cluster is used to ingest the data from the RDS database and make it available to the Spark cluster.
 * Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that can handle high volumes of data.
 * Spark: The Spark cluster is used to process the data and generate the reports.
 * Spark is a fast and scalable cluster computing framework.
 * Elasticsearch: The Elasticsearch cluster is used to store the reports and make them searchable.
 * Elasticsearch is a search engine that can be used to search and analyze large amounts of data.
 * UI: The UI is used to visualize the reports.
 * The UI can be a web application or a mobile application.
 * This is just a possible design for a real-time online reporting system based on upstream RDS data.
 * The specific design will depend on the specific requirements of the application.
