/**
 * NoSQL and SQL are two different types of databases. NoSQL databases are designed for scalability and flexibility, while SQL databases are designed for relational data.
 *
 * NoSQL databases are better for scaling because they do not rely on a strict relational schema. This means that they can store data in a variety of ways, which makes them more flexible and scalable. For example, NoSQL databases can store data in a key-value format, which is very efficient for storing large amounts of data.
 *
 * SQL databases, on the other hand, rely on a strict relational schema. This means that they can only store data in a certain way, which makes them less flexible and scalable. For example, SQL databases cannot store data in a key-value format.
 *
 * Here are some of the reasons why NoSQL databases are better for scaling:
 *
 * No schema: NoSQL databases do not require a schema, which means that they can store data in a variety of ways. This makes them more flexible and scalable than SQL databases, which require a strict schema.
 * Horizontal scaling: NoSQL databases can be scaled horizontally, which means that you can add more nodes to the database to increase its capacity. This is in contrast to SQL databases, which can only be scaled vertically, which means that you need to increase the capacity of each node.
 * In-memory storage: NoSQL databases can use in-memory storage, which can improve performance and scalability. This is in contrast to SQL databases, which typically use disk storage.
 * However, NoSQL databases also have some drawbacks, such as:
 *
 * Data consistency: NoSQL databases may not offer the same level of data consistency as SQL databases. This means that there is a possibility that reads and writes may not always reflect the latest data.
 * Data complexity: NoSQL databases can be more complex to manage than SQL databases. This is because they do not have a strict schema, which can make it difficult to track and manage data.
 * Overall, NoSQL databases are a good choice for applications that require scalability and flexibility. However, they may not be the best choice for applications that require strong data consistency and simplicity.
