I wanted to reach out with an opportunity (Scala Engineer) with one of our top clients.
I noticed your skills in software development particularly with your skill sets in Scala and Rust.
Here are some quick notes for the position itself:
- Scala / Rust
- API experience (RESTful API for Buy now)
- Terraform / AWS
- PostgreSQL DB (Core/Infra Team)
- Linux environment
- Full Remote
- Basic Japanese preferred, but not mandatory.
-----------------------------------------------
For this job position, would you be comfortable with the following responsibilities:
1.Knowledge of Functional Programming, Scala, and the Typelevel ecosystem
2.Understanding of software architecture and design with the ability to align the overall service architecture
3.Experience with building distributed systems, scalability and high throughput software
4.Experience with maintaining and further developing existing code base

Additionally, you would be able to work initially fully remotely,
however after a month or so of working,
the client would like for you to relocate to Japan and work remotely while being here.
It's a great opportunity to move to Japan, explore life in Japan, and also travel as well.
-----------------------------------------------
It's actually a very short and fast interview process.
First they will have a coding test,
and then it will be followed by two other interviews by the manager and the CTO if you pass the first test round.
