/**
 * The sliding window counter algorithm is a hybrid approach that combines the fixed window counter
 * and sliding window log. The algorithm can be implemented by two different approaches.
 * Sliding window counter is similar to fixed window counter,
 * but it smooths out bursts of traffic by adding a weighted count in previous window to the count in current window.
 * For example, suppose the limit is 10 per minute.
 * There are 9 requests in window [00:00, 00:01) and 5 requests in window [00:01, 00:02).
 * For a request arrives at 00:01:15, which is at 25% position of window [00:01, 00:02),
 * we calculate the request count by the formula: 9 x (1 - 25%) + 5 = 11.75 > 10.
 * Thus we reject this request.
 * Even though both windows donâ€™t exceed the limit,
 * the request is rejected because the weighted sum of previous and current window does exceed the limit.
