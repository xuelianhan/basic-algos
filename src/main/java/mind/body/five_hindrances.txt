Speech by Shi Heng Yi Master

1. Sensual desire (pleasures & distractions)
2. ill will (negative mind)
3. Slothful body & mind (lack of energy, lack of motivation)
4. Restlessness (worry about the future or regret about the past, unable to stay in the present)
5. Skeptical doubt (indecisiveness)

Each of these hindrances is placing a dark cloud on your mind.

Solution: Align and structure your life to prevent these hindrances from arising.

4 Steps to remove these Hindrances
1. Recognize (what state of mind you’re in)
2. Accept (accept and allow situations and people to be the way it is/they are)
3. Investigate (your emotional & mental state) - “why did it come up?” “what is the consequence if I remain in that state?”
4. Non identification (practice “I’m not the body, I’m not mind, I’m not my emotion, I can just see all these 3 aspects about me”)
There are 2 mistakes along the way to mastery
1. Not starting
2. Not going all the way

The most important part is practicing.
"I am not the body. I am not the mind. I am not my emotion. It's just that I can see all this three aspect about me"
"All of our lifetimes, all of our lives are too unique to copy the path from someone else"
"You can either experience the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. The choice is yours."
"If any of you chooses to climb that path to clarity, I would be very happy to meet you at the peak."
